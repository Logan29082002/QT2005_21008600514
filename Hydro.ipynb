I did a small project on this in college to learn about alternative green energy in my Physics & Technology of Solar Cells class. Its a great source of power in very specific circumstances. The problem is it doesn't really make any sense unless you are very far disconnected from the grid because it doesn't produce much power, it does generally take a lot of work to set up comparative to its power output and it is absolutely NOT reliable. If there is a drought now a whole community looses power, if the river freezes it can damage the plant, you need to have a river that travels at a steep enough grade, you need to keep it clear of debris and maintain it, etc. Unfortunately its not as simple as OP makes it seem.\\n\\nIt can be an excellent way to supplement things like solar or wind because it can form a more reliable base supply of power in certain situations. But when it comes down to it, solar has historically been cheaper and anywhere you can't do solar because youre not getting enough sunlight also probably has winters where this won't neccesarily work either.
