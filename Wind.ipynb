While this may run counter to \\\"common-sense\\\" about how habitat protection works, solid structures come at a premium in the sea, and even floating driftwood and algae mats draw in tiny animals from all over. This is partially why you'll see videos of [sunken ships with huge numbers of fish around them](https://youtu.be/bF-c6loxwtc); natural or not, structure is what these shallow water ecosystems are built on.\\n\\nLong term, offshore wind farms can be a [huuuuuuuge net gain](https://youtu.be/jIy8n-8hNwg) for local [biodiversity](https://youtu.be/ZEMh-Ndy6-k). Basically anything in the ocean that sessile animals and algae can attach to they will, and then the area becomes a productive habitat. Shallow water + structure = substantially more productivity than the same area of open ocean. Offshore wind farms can serve as [artificial reefs](https://youtu.be/WS4CGPji7m8): stationary organisms take root, drawing energy from either filter feeding or photosynthesis, and build atop these structures, drawing in fish, crustaceans, and then larger predators. These structures are great places for all kinds of marine organisms to reproduce, provide shelter for smaller organisms, and ultimately food for other animals. And as we see with marine protected areas, high productivity zones spill over into surrounding waters, supporting much more than just the protected zone. The number of birds killed would almost certainly be lower than the number of birds fed by all the new life supported by these artificial reefs, though this will take time to develop. Altogether, this makes offshore wind farms one of the absolute best sources of \\\"green energy,\\\" because they don't just not pollute the atmosphere, they have a direct positive effect on marine ecosystems.\\n\\nWhat I just said isn't hypothetical, it's been directly [observed](https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/09/22/149001/first-evidence-that-offshore-wind-farms-are-changing-the-oceans/) [many](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/we.324) [times.](https://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/offshore-renewable-energy-improves-habitat-increases-fish/) Negative effects of the sounds [on fishes](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:391860/FULLTEXT01.pdf) have been greatly overstated, and are almost certainly offset by the huge increase in local productivity. \\n\\nMy worry would be how to do maintenance on these turbines without doing too much damage to the ecosystems that will form around them.\"],[\"We were supposed to do something like that off the coast if my state.\\n\\nThen a bunch of rich assholes complained.\\n\\nImagine.\"],[\"B B But the Birds!\"],[\"Ambitious and commendable.

I'm interested because a lot of people see things like wind and solar as this silver bullet without realizing that power management is still a massive issue.  More storage, dealing with excess power somehow, those are really big issues.  If you're not careful (like what sometimes happens in So Cal when solar power is really flowing on sunny days) you can overpower the energy grid and the people managing the grid has to offload that power somewhere before the lines are compromised and the infrastructure is destroyed.  With wind I guess that's not as big of an issue because you can shut them down (hopefully).  Power storage is still an issue, though.\\n\\nI for one like the idea of using the excess power created through these renewables to power massive pumping stations that pump water up stream between several reservoirs.  Then when there isn't enough excess power, or there's a lack of power, they can open up hydro power stations between the reservoirs to create power.  Then rinse and repeat.

The money made from these leases goes to the U.S. Treasury Department, and, through public program funding, back into the pockets of taxpayers.\\n\\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the average winning bid from offshore oil and gas lease sales was $47 per acre. By contrast, the average winning bid for a wind lease sale was 125 times higher \\u2014 just over $5,900 per acre.
