It was never a good thing for their bottom line, only consumers. This is why cartels like OPEC exist to regulate production and keep prices high, and is why many third world countries subsidize fuel costs as a result.

I am a natural gas engineer that also works in an finance role.\\n\\nFirst, this is nothing but a short term problem for O&G producers. These prices are due to OPECs actions by artificially reducing prices by increasing supply (threatening to increase supply, they haven't even done it yet). The demand has not gone away. ALL countries are currently operating at negetive profit margins and therefore cannot sustain pricing in this environment. This will cause US O&G companies to go out of business (small ones) however larger companies/new companies will then be able to purchase O&G assets for cheap. When prices turn around these companies will stand to make large profits of cheaply bought assets which furthers O&G investments, development, ect.\\n\\nSecond, until there is a dramatic transition to electric vehicles oil has no competition in the vehicle market. All this will do is lower gas prices for the average consumer. The competition renewables have is with natural gas for electricity generation. If you look at the natural gas price for the same period you will see that it has remained relatively unchanged. (Natural gas and renewables also provide power slightly different also so that's not even a 1 to 1 comparison) Lower O&G prices reduce the cost to purchase the products and therefore make them even more affordable for car fuel, manufacturing, ect.\\n\\nLastly and least important is that renewables will never completly remove the O&G industry. It is used for everything in our daily lives. This is a short term problem and renewables are a long term solution to power.\\n\\nIMO (not that anyone cares) the only thing that will kill O&G from a power* perspective is major advancements in battery technology. The only fast solution to our current carbon problem is carbon capture of some form.\"],[\"Oil companies exist globally.

They\\u2019ll be able to deal with these negative profit margins for some time. Competition will be reduced if the smaller ones can\\u2019t stay afloat, however. So there\\u2019s some reason to be concerned there. \\n\\nNatural gas is still a cheap way to generate energy, but renewables are approaching grid parity pretty quickly (and it has been achieved in some quarters already.) So the writer has a point there. Renewable will keep growing. It will keep becoming more efficient. And our battery storage capabilities will do the same. \\n\\nWhat is affecting renewables right now is the supply chain. We get a lot of our materials from China, and even alternate countries we source from are themselves dependent on China. Given the recent events, I wouldn\\u2019t be surprised to see delayed shipments that ultimately affect project completion dates, which we were already going to see. And plenty of job sites are already shut down, thus giving materials that are ready for delivery nowhere to go.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a TON of work in renewables already contracted out for 2020 alone, with big tech companies leading the charge. They want to see these projects completed. We won\\u2019t move away from renewables, but renewable job sites (particularly new construction) will probably be seeing a pretty big slowdown if not a complete stoppage, depending on just how bad the pandemic gets. \\n\\nRegardless. Is the collapse of O&G good for renewables? No. Because it\\u2019s not a collapse. Prices will drop, become more competitive, and renewable-generated energy won\\u2019t be able to keep up with the cheaper market until demand raises the price of fossil fuels back up. \\n\\nIf anything, this might set us back from grid parity. Which ain\\u2019t good, chief. Pair that with the ITC and PTC tax credits being reduced at year-end, and renewable isn\\u2019t going to look so nice to investors who aren\\u2019t thinking long term. \\n\\nSo, what won\\u2019t change is the status of oil companies.

Prices should be $.90 per watt but retail is $5 per watt for a solar panel.\"],[\"Just wondering, Do people ever sit down and try to comprehend the actual energy consumption needed by our increasingly globalized world? Solar is not even in the same stratosphere as oil and natural gas yet, only in terms of providing electricity where is still falls short in. Let's just be realistic here, we can hope all we want, but people need to be educated rather than just believing solar will magically take over energy production and the world will be saved. \\n\\nAbout 40% of the energy pie is electricity, where natural gas and coal will continue to dominate until solar can figure out a way to store energy (this is the only thing standing in its way). Natural gas production for electricity is expected by the EIA to grow until 2040, even with the solar hype we've had for 10 years. And still, only a THIRD of natural gas produced goes to electricity. We need a scientific breakthrough in storage (that's also economic) if you want to see solar surpass fossil fuels anytime soon. \\n\\n Investors aren't throwing huge amounts of money at solar because solar can't power a bulk carrier, cargo ship, or a plane, and likely will never be able to. Yet at globalization grows, more goods are shipped, more people travel, more countries modernize and oil consumption continues to meteorically rise. Investors know they have to be in it for the long run, and they know it is years away. That's why you see the of the largest investors in solar are actually oil companies themselves! They know they'll still be around for the switch, and will be monetarily involved in it, which leads to this next point...\\n\\nSadly enough, once solar does become viable and starts to be globally implemented, this will cause a massive boom in oil production as the industrialization process ramps up. Old technologies are disposed of and new factories, ships, and materials are required to build these infrastructures. \\n\\nThis the reality of our current energy situation.

One way the cost of different energy sources was measured is called the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), which compares the overall building costs per energy output of different technologies. A certain energy output is recorded for every dollar spent on building that system. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), the levelized cost of solar energy has rapidly reduced to where it is now lower than that of coal, as \\\"Renewable energy technology, especially solar and wind, has made exponential gains in efficiency in recent years, enough to achieve economic competitiveness and, in an increasing number of cases, grid parity\\\".  Solar and wind energy costs have reached a point where they can confidently match against the price of fossil fuels. What achieving grid parity could mean for renewable energy sources is to completely substitute fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gases. These gases deteriorate the Earth's atmosphere and drive climate change. Using clean energy will furthermore avert the effects of climate change.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevelized costs of energy were used to determine which U.S. states are already at grid parity. GreenTechMedia Research found that 20 states have already reached solar energy prices lower than fossil fuel energy prices. These are mostly states that have a large exposure to sunlight, such as California or Arizona. However, the 42 other states and territories are not far behind. They should also reach grid parity by 2020 \\\"under business-as-casual conditions\\\". Grid parity will be inevitable at no additional effort. After all, the cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has been rapidly declining since the year 2000. While the price of electricity from fossil fuels has stayed relatively the same, the average LCOE of solar energy technology has decreased by more than 80% on average around the world. The expenses from solar power are declining much faster than traditional electricity prices ever have before. Five years ago, PV technology could not even be considered competitive. Declining prices of utility-scale PV has now caught the attention of residential solar-panel buyers (\\\"Distributed PV\\\") as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn a less macroeconomic scale, the price of solar electricity for individual consumers has also decreased significantly. Despite the recession which hit hard on American consumers, the LCOE of Distributed PV has still decreased by more than half (56%) since 2008. The lower costs therefore make rooftop solar panels more attractive to households and small businesses. Most recently, the number of solar installations increased by 34% from 2014 to 2015. A growth of more than 30% in a single year is impressive in any market. In many neighborhoods, solar power has actually become less expensive than buying electricity from the local utility company. An increasing number of households installing solar arrays will encourage a movement away from nonrenewable fossil fuels. Not only will residents be encouraged to switch power sources, but businesses as well. The WEF points out in their report that \\\"Renewable infrastructure has moved much closer to utility-like investments and no longer presents frontier technology-like risks\\\". The market for renewable energy has developed to a point where it is no longer a risky investment for corporations. Therefore, utility companies are able to move to cleaner technologies that will still increase profits, despite the important subsidies for fossil fuel corporations. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary incentive for companies to switch to solar energy is profits, generally in the form of government compensation. According to the International Energy Agency, nearly $500 billion was provided to fossil-fuel consumption, which makes government subsidies of fossil fuel energy four times higher than those for renewable energy sources. However, it's estimated that over 30 countries have reached grid parity without any subsidies. Although significant subsidies are present in the traditional fossil fuel industry, countries including the United States have moved past those and still exhibited renewable energy sources that meet grid parity. In the United States, there are other incentives to develop solar energy. One such incentive provided by the United States Treasury is the Thirty-Percent Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Under U.S. Code Title 26 Section 48A, businesses that invest in renewable power will receive a flat corporate tax credit of 30%, no matter the dollar amount of the investment. The ITC was renewed in 2008 for another eight years, which helps to explain such drastic solar energy growth until 2016. Substantial tax credits available to businesses, no matter of size, has helped mature the PV market even after the economic recession.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of renewable energy sources like solar energy has been decreasing at such a rate that coal energy's relatively stagnant market can never catch up to. Within the next decade, fossil fuel-sourced electricity may become completely overshadowed by solar power. The mere economic trend defines that solar energy will finally beat fossil fuels. Now that solar energy is officially cheaper than coal energy around the world, we can look forward to a cleaner future.\"],[\"world still needs nuclear if we are gonna be fossil fuel and gas free.\\n\\nenvironmentalists killed nuclear and nuclear development, thanks for dooming us.\\n\\nEDIT: storing large quantities of energy in the grid requires extremely expensive infrastructure too.\"],[\"solar doesn't provide a solution for mass production of electricity\"],[\"I am happy that we will no longer be dependent on oil states and get wrapped up in their backward and dangerous politics.

A lot. \\n\\nEdit: to clarify I'm absolutely on the side of solar. I'm just concerned that subsidies decentivize the responsible companies from making cheaper technology that is similarly effective, and as such, solar really isn't cheaper for kWh than everything else, and perhaps for that reason. Perhaps if they could provide the subsidies in such a way that they get them if and only if they bring the cost down or some other such nonsense while taking away from oil subsidies (as a commenter pointed out), I'd be on board.

Also, many utilities are fighting the net metering requirements, forcing people to buy batteries at a time when lithium is at an ATH.\\n\\nSolar panel prices dropping won\\u2019t mean shit when you gotta add $15k for a battery. The real solution is to fight against private utility companies and ensure net metering stays.\"],[\"FYI, any solar company that can't put in your address and email you a quote is scamming you. With Google maps they can see your roof line and estimate how many panels will fit and you can send them a pic of your electrical panel and location. \\n\\nI got solar for my house and the panels were only a tiny part of the cost. A 8kw system should only need 24 panels that are 340W each. If that's $200 each it would be less than $5k but inverters can be half that cost that is added on and the labor and permits doubles it! So from $7500 it goes to $18k or more.\\n\\nI paid $21k for a 8kw install and that was on the low end because companies are adding insane markups.\\n\\nSolar is only going to be commercially viable, home owners don't have the time to diy and installers charge too much as middle men.\"],[\"I don't think there are any legit solar businesses in the US.

Lots of people don't know that or the process, though. And there's a lot of factors to add in. You probably already knows (but for others reading) the shady solar companies aren't going to care whether the customer gets NEM 2.0 or 3.0. There are HOAs taking months to approve ARC plans. It takes time to research, go out, and get quality quotes, then officially lock in a contract, do all the official documents with the company and utility--which both are slammed right now. When the 2021/2022 version of NEM 3.0 was looming (before the pushed it back), there was a rush. The rush wasn'tnearly this bad, but it busy. My company had their stuff together and was super fast, so I went from estimate and signed contract docs mid-December 2021, (HOA taking FOREVER to get us the docs back), to install on January 26/27 and PTO with the utility five days later on January 31.
