Your body produces about 100 watts of energy. Thing is, there's a lot of sun that's doing fusion. The reason for this is that fusion events are very rare, even in a place like the core of the sun. That's why we're looking to create situations that are way more extreme than the core of the sun, and why it's so much harder to maintain stable hot plasmas. We really haven't made much progress since the 50s, 60s, and 70s in terms of a timeline for sustainable fusion. Fission power is fairly simple. Just put a bunch of fissile material together and it gets hot. The trick is not letting it get too hot by various control mechanisms. With fusion you have to create temperatures and pressures so high that they'd melt or destroy any material, so we have to figure out how to bind the hot plasma with magnetic fields. All the research and work has mostly just been various mathematical models trying to figure out how to stably contain all that. Alternatively, there are some approaches where we just try to compress a pellet into that same hot dense plasma to create fusion events, but it's still all about pouring huge amounts of energy into creating that fusion plasma.

This will likely continue for a few years just to find out if it's actually possible to make a large stable fusion reactor that generates more energy than you put into it.\\n\\nAFTER THAT, if all goes well, the successor to ITER will be built: The DEMO reactor. This reactor will be larger than ITER and will be hooked up to gas turbines that generate electricity. It's kind of like a beta version (or a demo) of a proper nuclear fusion power plant. This facility will probably not be done before 2050, and who knows when it's fully operational and has gone through all the testing. 2060? This won't even be hooked up to the power grid. \\n\\nOnly after that, if all goes well, we can start to build full scale nuclear fusion power plants. These will take many years to build and probably won't generate electricity for the power grid until 2080, and we will most likely pass the year 2100 before nuclear fusion power plants are starting to be commonplace in the power grid. \\n\\nAnd this is if all goes exactly as planned.

To name a few problems that still need to be overcome:\\n\\n1. The lasers delivered 2.05 MJ of energy to the fuel capsule, and 3.15 MJ of energy was produced by fusion. But the lasers required 300 MJ of energy to accomplish this, meaning this is what they took from the regular power grid in order to deliver the 2.05 MJ.\\n2. The lasers can only be fired a few times a day, but need to be fired a few times a minute for an actual reactor.\\n3. The National Ignition Facility is the size of three football fields, and would need to be substantially smaller for an actual reactor.\\n4. None of the produced energy was captured in a way that can be used to generate electricity\\n5. A single fuel capsule currently takes months to build, but a commercial reactor would go through thousands a day.\\n\\nAgain, I don't want to minimize what they did: it was a true feat of theoretical physics and engineering, and a very necessary first step towards a real fusion reactor.

In internal confinement fusion, the atomic nuclei are heated to very high temperatures so that they fuse together, releasing energy. This is typically done using lasers or other forms of high-energy radiation.\\n\\nMagnetic confinement fusion, on the other hand, uses magnetic fields to contain and control the hot plasma that is created when atomic nuclei are fused together. This allows the plasma to be kept at the high temperatures and densities required for fusion to occur for longer periods of time. The most common method of magnetic confinement fusion is called tokamak confinement, in which the plasma is contained inside a doughnut-shaped device called a tokamak.\\n\\nIn general, magnetic confinement fusion is considered to be a more promising approach to achieving fusion than internal confinement fusion, because it allows for longer periods of time for the fusion reactions to occur and for the plasma to be contained at the high temperatures and densities required for fusion. However, both approaches have their challenges and limitations, and further research is needed to fully understand and control the process of fusion.\"],[\"So we can convert 2 megajoules of laser light energy to 3 megajoules of thermal energy.\\n\\nBut we cannot convert that 3 megajoules of thermal energy to 2 megajoules of laser light energy for powering the next blast. You need about 1000 megajoules of thermal energy to power the laser.

Capturing 1 megajoules of energy produced in 0.5 nanoseconds is not really feasible at this point without losing much of that energy.  Even if we capture the heat of the total reaction, the most efficient plants now can only convert about 63% of heat to electricity.  This would produce 0.94% of the initial invested usable energy.  \\n\\n  \\nThe hope is that in the future, we can somehow make the reaction self sustaining while we continue to deliver fuel to the system.  Then the output beyond ignition is basically free.  Then the problem of utilizing that energy will have to be figured out.  The entire containment will have to be redesigned to allow the heat to be absorbed in a controllable way.  \\nThis part is a super cool achievement for sure and hopefully it is the hardest part of the puzzle to be solved, but scalability and capture are significant challenges.\"],[\"This is why Republicans sold their soul to try and win the last few elections and why they want dictatorship.\"],[\"3-2=1.5?\\n\\nI\\u2019ll take a job.

This kind of model for a fusion reactor has been around for a while and it sounds like they made one that works very well, but they won't even start to create fusion reactions until 2019, at which time they will run into the same problem that every one else has: it takes more energy to start the reaction than you can get out of it. That problem isn't going away any time soon and it's the real reason why fusion tech is perpetually 30 years out. \\n\\nIt'll be awesome if someone eventually figures it out but our energy crisis is happening now and fusion isn't the answer, renewable energy sources like solar and wind are. \"],[\"2 questions: \\n\\n1.

More energy has to be put into the fusor to cause the fusion reaction than is produced by the fusion reaction itself. Other research fusion reactors built so far have all had the same problem.\\n\\nSo far, the only fusion device ever made by humans that *does* produce more energy than is put into it is the hydrogen bomb. Those are obviously rather impractical as anything other than a weapon, but they do prove that fusion can be harnessed.

Basically the way we currently harness energy from fission is pretty primitive.
